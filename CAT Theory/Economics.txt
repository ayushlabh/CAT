==> Exchange rate of currency 

-> Two types :

	i) Floating exchange rate - Value which is solely determined by the demand for and supply of the currency on the foreign exchange market.
	
							  - Therefore , governments can't influence the value of the currency .

   ii) Fixed exchange rate - When a currency's value is fixed to other major currency .
								
								eg. Saudi Riyal is pegged to US dollar at 1 USD = 3.75 SR

								
								

==> Foreign exchange market ( Forex ) - Value of a currency is determined by the supply and demand of the currency .

-> Value varies directly with demand i.e. higher demand means higher value of the currency.

-> Value varies inversely with supply i.e. higher supply means lower value of the currency .

-> Demand of a countries currency increases if the country exports more coz more currency of that country is required to purchase goods .

-> Supply of a countries currency increases if the country imports more coz more foreign currency is required to purchase goods and 
   in place more rupee is supplied to forex market .

	eg. (i) If India exports more to US , US need more Rupee to purchase goods from India and hence demand of Rupee will increas.
	
	   (ii) If India imports more from US , India need more dollar so it supplies more rupee for dollar and hence supply of rupee will increase.

	   
	   

								
==> Balance of payment :

-> Method countries use to monitor all international monetary transactions at a specific period

-> Usually, the BOP is calculated every quarter and every calendar year

-> All trades conducted by both the private and public sectors are accounted for in the BOP								
								
	   
	   
	   
==> Types of accounts for BOP: 

	- Current Account : i) Goods and services.
					   ii) Payment of loan
					  iii) Money sent to family 	

	- Capital Account/Financial Account : Country owned assets abroad 
	
										   eg.i) US-citizen purchasing home in India.
											 ii) Indian purchasing stock of American company IBM .
