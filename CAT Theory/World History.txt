* Add timelines and location
-----------------------------------

1) Earth formation

	-> 4.6 billions years ago
	
	-> Cloud of gas and dust (known as solar nebula) collapsed together due to gravity (process is known as accretion) to form solar system
	
	-> With Sun at the center , more dust began to clump up and formed planets. Earth was one of them
	
	-> Initial it was all volcanoes and molten lava on the surface , then it cooled and formed earth surface
	
	-> After that atmosphere is formed

2) First appearance of life / evolution from initial life to pre-historic humans

3)Pre-historic humans 

	-> Appeared around 2.5 millions years ago in africa
	
	-> Belonged to genus 'homo' (homo = man)
	
	-> Discovered fire and stone tools
	
	-> Traveled to different parts of the world and then evolved into different homos

	( need to add more)
	
	
	
4) Appearance of Homo sapiens and their travel across the globe/Extinction of other humans

	-> Paleolithic solieties (Paleo = old , lithic = stone ) , old stone age ( 250000 years to 12000 years old )
	
	-> Mainly Hunters , gatherers and fishers 
	
	-> Bands of 20-50 people who used to move continuously
	
	-> Apart from other homos , sapiens had language which made them the superior species as they can make complex social groups
		and they outlived others
	
	-> Homo Sapiens evolved around 150,000 years ago in eastern Africa (current day euthopia)
	
	-> Crossed africa and moved to eurasia (middle east) around 100,000 years ago and spread toward europe and asia
	
	-> Reached India around 70,000 years ago
	
	-> Moved along the edges of Russia and china as it was completely covered with ice
	
	-> Through south east asia (Indonasia) reached Australia around 45,000 year ago
	
	-> Reached North america through Alaska around 15,000 years ago
	
	-> Rapid expansion to central and south america along the coast around in next 2000 years
	
	-> From Australia through miconesia to newzealand around 3500 years ago (1500 BC)
	
	-> Fauna of Australia was greatly damaged by humans as till the time humans reached australia the were well equipped and were great hunter
	   while the fauna in Australia as directly got in contact with humans didn't get time to adapt (to be more agile) like fauna of other places


	   
5) First agricultural revolution / neolithic revolution ( neo = new , lithic = stone )

	-> Started somewhere around 10,000 B.C. at different places mainly middle east , central africa , china , north and south africa .
		Its not sure if the idea of farming spread from one origin to other places or started at different locations independently.
	
	-> Hunters and gatherers started farming for their dietary need
	
	-> Domestication of animals started
	
	-> People were not as healthy as they were during the times of hunting and gathering , because of reduced protein content
		in their diet and less movement/agility
		
	

6) Civilizations ( list them all with timeline and characteristics and decline)

	-> With the start of agricultural revolution , people started to get time for other things
	
	-> Most people settled on the banks of major rivers that eventually became major civilizations
	
	-> Major features of a civilization : Urban settlement , Full time specialists (not involved in agriculture) , surplus production ,
										  Class structure , state-level organization (government) , Cultural societies
										  
	-> Some prominent civilizations :
	
	i) Mesopotamian civilization (Meso = between , potamos = rivers )
		
		- located in middle east near Tigris and Euphrates rivers (4000 B.C. - 500 B.C. )
			
		- Earliest civilization , known as "cradle of civilization"
		
		- Sumerians living in south and Akkadians living in north
		
		- Discovered wheel (around 3500 BC) by Sumerians 
		
		- Sargon the great , ruler of AKkadian empire spread it to north and south ( around 2300 BC )
		
		- Rise of Babylonian empire by king Hummurabi ( around 1800 BC ) 
		
		- Babylonian empire was toppled by assyrian empire which then taken over by neobabylonian empire
		
		- They are overthrown by Persians and Cyrus the great ( around 600 BC )
		
		
	ii) Ancient Egypt civilization 
	
		- Agriculture was happening on the bank on Nile river from around 8000 BC
		
		- Start of ancient Egypt civilization is marked by the unification of north and south egypt by king menes at around 3100 BC
		
		- Pyramids were built at around 2500 BC
